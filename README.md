# Burger House

- A student mockup project redone completely from scratch & updated with CSS3 and JavaScript
- A **no-Bootstrap**, **no-framework** single-page responsive website that utilizes **plain JavaScript** and **SASS (SCSS)** only!
- Includes Google maps, although with an API key that can only make one or two requests a day due to regional issues with my account.
